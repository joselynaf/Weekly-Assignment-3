## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.


```r
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label=TRUE),
         wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  group_by(vegetable, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(total_weight = sum(wt_lbs)) %>% 
  arrange(weekday) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from= weekday,
              values_from = total_weight)
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'vegetable'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?


```r
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(total_harvest=sum(wt_lbs)) %>% 
  left_join(garden_planting,
            by= "variety")
```

The problem is that because there aren't the same amount of variables both datasets, there are missing values. In order to make the data more uniform, you could filter out the NA values that aren't in both datasets.

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  
  In order to do this, you can left_join the garden_harvest data with the garden_spending dataset through "vegetable". After this, you could create a new dataset, and label it vegetable_spending. After this, you could left-join the vegetable_spending dataset with the whole foods dataset by "vegetable" and compare the prices from both data.

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.


```r
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  mutate(variety=fct_reorder(variety, date),
    wt_lbs= weight*0.00220462) %>%
  group_by(variety, date) %>% 
  summarize(total_harvest= sum(wt_lbs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=variety, x=total_harvest)) +
    geom_col(fill= "gold") +
  ggtitle("Total Harvest in Pounds of Tomato Varieties")+
  theme(axis.title = element_blank())
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'variety'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  

```r
garden_harvest %>% 
  select(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  mutate(lowercase_variety = str_to_lower(variety),
         length_variety = str_length (lowercase_variety)) %>% 
  arrange(length_variety) %>% 
  distinct()
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.


```r
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(distinct_variety = str_detect(variety, "er|ar")) %>% 
  filter(distinct_variety == TRUE)

## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.


```r
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

```
## 
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## cols(
##   name = col_character(),
##   lat = col_double(),
##   long = col_double(),
##   nbBikes = col_double(),
##   nbEmptyDocks = col_double()
## )
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sdate))+

  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time)) +
  geom_density(fill="darkorchid3") + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Daily Bike Rental by Time") +

  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=weekday))+
           geom_bar(fill= "skyblue") +

  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day,
         weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightblue") + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Bike Rental During the Week by Time") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(vars(weekday))
```

Yes, during the weekdays there are two peaks of time in which there are more bike rentals, however during weekends, the distribution is more of an even slope rising throughout the day and then tapering downwards as the day ends.

The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. 

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day,
         weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha =.5, color = NA) + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Bike Rentals During the Week by Time") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(vars(weekday))
```

![](03_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day,
         weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha =.5, color = NA, position=position_stack()) + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Bike Rentals During the Week by Time") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(vars(weekday))
```

In general, this second graph provides a clearer comparison between Casual and Registered bike clients, which would make it a more appealing method of demonstrating the data. However, in order to be able to stack the data in a more visually appealing way, there were slight alterations to the placement of the data, which could affect accuracy. 

  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day,
         weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE),
         weekend = ifelse(weekday %in% c("Sat","Sun"), "weekend","weekday")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=time, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha =.5, color = NA) + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Bike Rentals During the Week by Time") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(weekend))
```

![](03_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day= hour(sdate),
         minute_of_day= minute(sdate)/60,
         time = hour_of_day + minute_of_day,
         weekday = wday(sdate, label=TRUE),
         weekend = ifelse(weekday %in% c("Sat","Sun"), "weekend","weekday")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=time, fill = weekday)) +
  geom_density(alpha =.5, color = NA) + 
  ggtitle("Frequency of Bike Rentals During the Week by Time") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(client))

 This graph displays the patterns of bike rentals during the week for registered versus casual clients. It shows that casual have a more uniform bike rental period throughout the week regardless of day, while registered clients tend to rent bikes at specific times of the day during weekdays.
 
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations, 
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  group_by(lat,long) %>% 
  summarize(n_departures = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = lat, x = long, color = n_departures)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red")+
  ggtitle("Map of Total Number of Departures from Stations")+
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(col="Number of Departures")
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'lat'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```
## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](03_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations, 
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  group_by(lat,long) %>% 
  mutate(client_casual= client=="Casual") %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(client_casual)/n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=lat,x=long,color=prop)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Map of the number of departures from stations by casual clients") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank())
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'lat'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```
## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](03_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->
Here it shows that the proportion of bike rentals from stations is low and spread out because casual renters are likely to rent from a more diverse set of stations.  
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  

```r
top_ten_stations <-
Trips %>% 
  mutate(just_date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  group_by(sstation, just_date) %>% 
  summarize(num_depart= n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_depart)) %>% 
  head(10)
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sstation'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```r
top_ten_stations
```

  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(just_date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  right_join(top_ten_stations, by = c("sstation", "just_date"))

  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.

```r
Trips %>% 
  mutate(just_date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  right_join(top_ten_stations, by = c("sstation", "just_date")) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(sdate, 
                  label=TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(weekday,client) %>% 
  summarize(client_depart= n()) %>% 
  group_by(client) %>% 
  mutate(prop= client_depart/sum(client_depart)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = weekday,
              names_from = client,
              values_from = prop)
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'weekday'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

This table is showing how the pattern of bike rentals by casual and registered clients changes by day. While registered bike renters have a mostly even proportion of bike rentals throughout the weekdays with a lower proportion of rentals during the weekend, the proportion of bike rentals for casual clients tends to be focused on the weekend, particularly Saturday.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
